# TreeHacks 2019: Civic Engagement through Citizen X
### #hackwithtrees with Cliff Panos & Cal Stephens

### Become a Next-Generation Citizen. Use your voice to learn about your political sphere.

We designed Citizen X to not only inform citizens about their representatives but also to engage them, start discussions, and inspire people to expand their knowledge about their political climates and connect them to other resources
